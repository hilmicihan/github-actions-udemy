# Running the Flask API Project Locally

To run the Flask API project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository for the project to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install Flask and pytest using `pip`:

pip install flask pytest


4. Install `flasgger` using `pip`:

pip install flasgger

5. Run the unit tests to make sure everything is working correctly:

pytest

6. If the tests pass, start the Flask development server:

python app.py


7. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to test the "Hello, World!" endpoint.
8. Test the other API endpoints using a tool like `curl` or a web API testing tool like Postman.
9. To view the Swagger documentation, navigate to `http://localhost:5000/apidocs` in your web browser.
10. When you're finished testing the app, stop the Flask development server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in your terminal.
